# Runar Framework Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating various features and patterns of the Runar framework.

## Available Examples

### Node API Example
A comprehensive example demonstrating proper service implementation and registration using the Runar Node API.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Creating and configuring a node
- Creating a custom service that handles events
- Proper service registration using `add_service()`
- Making service requests using the request-based API
- Using `vmap!` for clean parameter extraction
- Proper service implementation following the `AbstractService` trait
- Event handling and storage

**To run this example:**
```bash
cargo run --example node_api_example
```

### Macro Example
A comprehensive example demonstrating proper usage of Runar macros for service definition and integration.

**Features demonstrated:**
- Using the `service!` macro to define services
- Proper field initialization in service structs
- Implementing action handlers with the `action!` macro
- Subscribing to events with the `sub!` macro
- Service-to-service communication via events
- Complete task management application with analytics

**To run this example:**
```bash
cargo run --example macro_example
```

## Running Examples

Each example can be run using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

## Best Practices Shown in Examples

The examples in this directory follow Runar's architectural guidelines and best practices:

1. **Service Definition**: Services are defined using the `AbstractService` trait or the `service!` macro, properly implementing all required methods.

2. **Service Registration**: Services are registered using the `add_service()` method instead of deprecated approaches.

3. **Request-Based API**: Examples use the request-based API pattern for service interactions, avoiding direct access to service methods.

4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Where applicable, examples demonstrate how to use Runar's event system for communication between services.

5. **Clean Parameter Extraction**: Examples show how to use the `vmap!` macro for safely extracting parameters with default values.

6. **Field Initialization**: Services properly initialize fields in their struct definitions, following best practices.

## Adding New Examples

When adding new examples, please follow these guidelines:

1. Place your example file in the `examples/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `feature_name_example.rs`
3. Include thorough documentation in your example explaining what it demonstrates
4. Mark "correct" patterns with âœ… in comments to highlight proper usage
5. Consider adding your example to this README file
